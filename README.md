# Shadow Knights  

**Hand Gesture Analyzer**  

A project using Arduino Nano, flex sensors, and an IMU to recognize hand gestures and transmit messages over Bluetooth to a serial monitor. Designed with accessibility in mind, it can be extended for more complex functionalities, like device control and automation.  

## Features  
- Gesture recognition using flex sensors and IMU.  
- Bluetooth communication for real-time feedback.  
- Expandable design for additional functionality.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Hardware:** Arduino Nano, Flex Sensors, IMU  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python  

## How It Works  
1. The IMU and flex sensors detect hand movements and gestures.  
2. The Arduino processes the sensor data to identify gestures.  
3. Recognized gestures are transmitted via Bluetooth to another device.
